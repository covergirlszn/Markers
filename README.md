When the shorthand margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and margin-left and margin-right to the second value

color models: the additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices,
and the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print.

i think that's quite cool tbh but what is additive and subtractive. so the highest level in cmyk is black?

or the higher the level of c in cmyk the less blue. it makes sense tbh because cyan is the blue and green, the magenta is red and blue but red and green is yellow, light wise. i need to check how cmyk works!!

- a bit obvioujs but the rgb level in css is very much  a function because it takes values and makes something new out of it... cute
