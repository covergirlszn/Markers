# Markers
v simple. note that the best w√© to learn html is practice, not notes darling

When the shorthand margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and margin-left and margin-right to the second value

color models: the additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices,
and the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print.

i think that's quite cool tbh but what is additive and subtractive. so the highest level in cmyk is black?

or the higher the level of c in cmyk the less blue. it makes sense tbh because cyan is the blue and green, the magenta is red and blue but red and green is yellow, light wise. i need to check how cmyk works!!

- a bit obvioujs but the rgb level in css is very much  a function because it takes values and makes something new out of it... cute

-While the red and blue markers look the same, the green one is much lighter than it was before. This is because the green color keyword is actually a darker shade, and is about halfway between black and the maximum value for green.

fun fact, rgb(255,127,0) gives you orange. that's mixing a secondary colour with a primary colour. it makes sense kinda because red and yellow make orange and redd is 255 0 0 and yellow is 255 255 0.

the average of those would give you orange, fka 255, 127, 0.... 127 is half of 255, if you round up ofc

donc. to make rose par exemple, c'est red and magenta. red is 255,00, magenta is 255,0,255
alors rose is 255 0 and 127?

yessir :)

oh also if you want to give a class specific values, ie marker rose. then don't use spaces. as in if you want it to have the characteristics of both marker and another class then specify both classes in html then in the css say
".marker.rose"
