    <div class="marker one"></div>
<!--btw:
To give the markers different colors, you will need to add a unique class to each one. 
Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the 
class attribute and separating them with a space. For example, the following adds both the animal and dog classes to a div element.-->
